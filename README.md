# Blog-project

## Description 

This project is a simple blog web application that allows users to create, view, and manage blog posts. The user can switch between a light or dark mode and clear all blog posts if needed. The application uses `localstorage` to save and retrieve blog posts.

## Usage 

### Creating a Blog Post

1. Open `index.html`
2. Fill out the form containing your username, blog title, and content.
3. Click on the submit button
4. When filled out correctly, you will be redirected to the `blog.html` page where your blog post will be displayed.

### Viewing and Clearing Posts

1. Open `blog.html` in your default browser.
2. Saved blog posts will be displayed.
3. Use the Toggle light/dark mode button to switch in between the two themes.
4. Use the clear button to remove all the blog posts from `localStorage`.
